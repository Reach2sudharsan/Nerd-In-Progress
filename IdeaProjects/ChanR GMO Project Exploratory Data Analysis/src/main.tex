    \section{Overview:}

    \vspace{5}
    The first part of my GMO project is to survey several people
    and ask them questions related to GMOs to get an overall idea
    of their general knowledge of the topic.
    I asked them 18 questions, 17 of which were multiple choice.
    The remaining one asks to write the full form of the word
    GMO\@.
    After surveying them, I performed some data analysis on the data
    I received.
    All the survey data was stored in a Google spreadsheet.
    As I wanted to get more responses overtime, I used a Google
    Spreadsheets API to directly access the data from the spreadsheet
    rather than downloading a csv of the data multiple times.
    Using a Python based Jupyter Notebook, I created a Pandas
    DataFrame and plotted the percentages of the people that got
    each question right and those who got them wrong.

    \section{Survey Questions:}
    \textbf{Notes:}
    Question 2 asks to write the full form of GMOs.
    Because people would have either used or not used
    capitalization in their response the same as each other,
    making a pie unreasonable.
