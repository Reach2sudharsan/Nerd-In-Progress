    <h2>History</h2>
      <div><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/NeXTcube_first_webserver.JPG/440px-NeXTcube_first_webserver.JPG"></div>
      <p>Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989 while working at CERN. He also developed
        the foundations for the Web: HTTP, HTML, the WorldWideWeb browser, a server, and the first website 
        for documentation.
      </p>

    <h2>Evolution</h2>
      <div><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/880/1*QWzSh_4CnUaK_UQFxrmGDA.jpeg"></div>
      <p><i>The different versions of the Web overtime</i></p>
      <p>The web underwent several changes as time passed, primarily security and privacy updates.
        Especially because people have so much more and easier access to data nowadays, many try 
        and take advantage of that to steal data and engage in other criminal activities.
      </p>
    
    <h2 class="mt-5">Future</h2>
      <div><img src="https://www.techexplorist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Future-Internet-696x391.jpg"></div>
      <p>The web will definitely last very long, and it will evolve substantially in the coming decades. The web will soon be
        characterized by devleopment technologies such as Quantum Computing, Accelerated Mobile Pages, Progressive Web Apps, 
        Artificial Intelligence, Voice Search, Motion UI, and many more.

    <h2>Search Engines</h2>
      <div><img src="https://wildstonesolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Search-Engine.jpg" style="width:350px ; height:200px"></div>
      <p><i>Example search engines</i></p>
      <p>Search engines are software systems that are designed to carry out web searches. They search through the World Wide Web in a systematic way 
        for specific information noted in a textual web search query. The search results are usually seen through the search engine results pages, which
        show a line of different results.
      </p>

    <h2>Search Algorithms</h2>
      <div><img src="https://www.cs-ib.net/assets/img/graph-theory.png"></div>
      <p><i>A graph of nodes that can be used to represent interconnected web pages (important for search algorithms)</i></p>
      <p>Search algorithms in computer science are designed to search for a particular element from some kind of data structure. In the context of web
        science, search algorithms will search using different aspects of web pages such as the time that a page has existed and the frequency of 
        the search keywords on the page. PageRank and HITS are two very popular search algorithms. PageRank works by counting the number and quality 
        of inlinks of a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is. For HITS, based on the idea that keywords are not everything 
        that matters; there are sites that might be more relevant even if they don’t contain the most keywords. It introduces the idea of different types 
        of pages, authorities and hubs. Search algorithms use complex graph theory for searching; all web pages are essentially nodes of a graph.

    <h2>Web Graphs</h2>
    <div><img src="https://www.cs-ib.net/assets/img/graph-theory.png" style="width:350px ; height:200px"></div>
    <p><i>Example graph</i></p>
    <p>
      Purposes:
      <ul>
        <li>Describe the directed links between pages of the World Wide Web.</li>
      </ul>

      Advantages:
      <ul>
        <li>Present information quickly and easily</li>
        <li>Graphically represented data is usually easier to understand.</li>
        <li>Calculations can be done with little or no software</li>
      </ul>

      Disadvantages:
      <ul>
        <li>Can oversimplyfy data.</li>
        <li>Some queries may not do well in graph-oriented tasks (especially linear queries)</li>
      </ul>

      When Used:
      <ul>
        <li>Computing the PageRank of the WWW-pages.</li>
        <li>Detecting web pages of similar topics through graph-theoretical properties only.</li>
        <li>Identifying hubs and authorities in the web for the HITS algorithm.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Web Crawlers</h2>
    <div><img src="https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/what_is_Web_Crawler.jpg" style="width:350px ; height:200px"></div>
    <p>
      Purposes:
      <ul>
        <li>Browses the web in a methodical and automated manner.</li>
        <li>For each page it finds, a copy is downloaded and indexed. In this process it extracts all links 
          from the given page and then repeats the same process for all found links.</li>
      </ul>

      Advantages:
      <ul>
        <li>Can extract data automatically from various competitors' websites without any hassle.</li>
        <li>The crawl system should make efficient use of various system resources including processor, storage and network bandwidth.</li>
      </ul>

      Disadvantages:
      <ul>
        <li>They might look at meta data contained in the head of web pages, but this depends on the crawler</li>
        <li>A crawler might not be able to read pages with dynamic content as they are very simple programs</li>
      </ul>

      When Used:
      <ul>
        <li>Used to traverse the web by downloading documents and following links from page to page.</li>
        <li>It is a tool for the search engines and other information seekers to gather data for indexing and to enable them to keep their databases up to date.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Parallel Web Crawlers</h2>
    <p>
      Purposes:
      <ul>
        <li>Browses the web in a methodical and automated manner.</li>
        <li>For each page it finds, a copy is downloaded and indexed. In this process it extracts all links 
          from the given page and then repeats the same process for all found links.</li>
      </ul>

      Advantages:
      <ul>
        <li>Scalability: as the web grows a single process can not handle everything Multithreaded processing can solve the problem</li>
        <li>Network load dispersion: as the web is geographically dispersed, dispersing crawlers disperses the network load</li>
        <li>Network load reduction</li>
      </ul>

      Disadvantages:
      <ul>
        <li>Overlapping: parallel web crawlers might index the same page multiple times</li>
        <li>Quality: If a crawler wants to download ‘important’ pages first, this might not work in a parallel process</li>
        <li>Communication bandwidth: parallel crawlers need to communicate for the former reasons, which for many processes might 
          take significant communication bandwidth</li>
        <li>If parallel crawlers request the same page frequently over a short time it will overload servers</li>
      </ul>

      When Used:
      <ul>
        <li>Runs multiple processes in parallel.</li>
        <li>Used to maximize the download rate while minimizing the overhead from parallelization and to avoid 
          repeated downloads of the same page.</li>
        <li>Identifying hubs and authorities in the web for the HITS algorithm.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Meta Tags</h2>
    <p>
      Purposes:
      <ul>
        <li>Meta tags are essentially little content descriptors that help tell search engines what a web page is about.</li>
        <li>The title tag, not strictly a meta-tag, is what is shown in the results, through the indexer</li>
      </ul>

      Advantages:
      <ul>
        <li>A compelling meta description has the power to raise the click-through rate of your organic search results.</li>
      </ul>

      Disadvantages:
      <ul>
        <li>While meta-tags used to play a role in ranking, this has been overused by many pages and therefore 
          meta-tags are not considered by most search engines anymore.
        </li>
        <li>A crawler might not be able to read pages with dynamic content as they are very simple programs</li>
      </ul>

      When Used:
      <ul>
        <li>Used to describe the content on a webpage.</li>
        <li>helps search engines understand what it's about so you can show up in the relevant search results.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Robots.txt</h2>
    <p><i>Example search engines</i></p>
    <p>
      Purposes:
      <ul>
        <li>A robots. txt file tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on your site.</li>
        <li>A robots.txt file contains instructions for bots that tell them which webpages they can and cannot access.</li>
      </ul>

      Advantages:
      <ul>
        <li>Index certain areas of the website or a whole website.</li>
        <li>Index specific files on a website (images, videos, PDFs)</li>
        <li>Prevent duplicate content pages from appearing in SERPs.</li>
        <li>Index entire sections of a private website (for instance, your staging site or an employee site)</li>
      </ul>

      Disadvantages:
      <ul>
        <li>Robots.txt directives may not be supported by all search engines.</li>
        <li>Different crawlers interpret syntax differently. Although respectable web crawlers follow the directives in a robots.</li>
      </ul>

      When Used:
      <ul>
        <li>Used mainly to avoid overloading your site with requests</li>
        <li>Used to identify restricted or private areas of a site's contents.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Web Indexing</h2>
    <div><img src="https://www.web-indexing.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Web-Indexing.jpg" style="width:350px ; height:200px"></div>
    <p>
      Purposes:
      <ul>
        <li>Search engines index websites in order to respond to search queries with relevant information as quick as possible.</li>
        <li>Indexing has the additional purpose of giving a page a certain weight, as described in the search algorithms. This 
          way search results can be ranked, after being indexed.</li>
      </ul>

      Advantages:
      <ul>
        <li>Proper website indexing allows search engines to see all of your important pages and gives your site a major boost.</li>
        <li>Ensure that filed papers are located easily and quickly whenever they are needed.</li>
      </ul>

      Disadvantages:
      <ul>
        <li>Since Indexes physically take up space on the Disk, using the Index will increase the extra disk cost unless necessary.</li>
        <li>In general, indexes improve performance in our Select queries and slow down DML (insert, update, delete) operations.</li>
      </ul>

      When Used:
      <ul>
        <li>A search index is a body of structured data that a search engine refers to when looking for results that are relevant to a specific query.</li>
        <li>Detecting web pages of similar topics through graph-theoretical properties only.</li>
      </ul>
